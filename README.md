# geo-tweets
![tweets](/img/tweets.png)
This map created using QGIS and base map called Dark Mater (retina) under CartoDB.

Points plotted on the map is real tweets from twitter users who tagged their geographic location on their tweets. Using twitter streamline API, I was able to search all the geo-tagged tweets with the keyword **"pandemic"** within the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii for easier visualization purposes. The code ran for one hour of duration to collect live data.

Large portion of the tweets were gathered from populated city and state as illustrated on the map. California, New York, and other states along the coastline. Coastline cities tends to have younger generation with up-to-date technology and more lively on social network. Although demographics of the users were not collected for this lab, people from urban cities are typically more connected in the network environment.
